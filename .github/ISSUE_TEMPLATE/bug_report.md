**What is the current behavior?**


**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**


<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->
<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->
<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->
<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->
<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->
